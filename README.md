# Summary

Modern astronomical surveys have multiple competing scientific goals.
Optimizing the observation schedule for these goals presents significant computational and theoretical challenges, and state-of-the-art methods rely on expensive human inspection of simulated telescope schedules.
Automated methods, such as reinforcement learning, have recently been explored to accelerate scheduling.
**DeepSurveySim** provides methods for tracking and approximating sky conditions for a  set of observations from a user-supplied telescope configuration.

# Documentation

### [ReadTheDocs](https://deepsurveysim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Build locally

First install the package from source, then run

```
pip install sphinx
cd docs
make html
```

The folder `docs/_build/html` will be populated with the documentation.
Navigate to `file:///<path to local install>/docs/_build/html/index.html` in any web browser to view.



# Installation
### Install from pip

Simply run

```
pip install DeepSurveySim
```

This will install the project with all its mandatory requirements.

If you wish to include the optional `skybright`, use the command:

```
pip install DeepSurveySim[skybright]
```

Not installing this will result in loss of the variables `sky_magintude`, `tau`, and `teff`, but will work on most (if not all) machines.

### Install from source

The project is built with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and this is the recommended install method.
All dependencies are resolved in the `poetry.lock` file, so you can install immediately from the command

```
git clone https://github.com/deepskies/DeepSurveySim.git
poetry shell
poetry install --all-extras
```

Assuming you have poetry installed on your base environment.
This will use lock file to install all the correct versions.
To use the installed environment, use the command `poetry shell` to enter it.
The command `exit` will take you out of this environment as it would for any other type of virtual environment.

Otherwise, you can use the `pyproject.toml` with your installer of choice.

To verify all the depedencies are properly installed - run `python run pytest`.

# Example:

## To run as a live envoriment for RL

```
from DeepSurveySim.Survey.survey import Survey
from DeepSurveySim.IO.read_config import ReadConfig

seo_config = ReadConfig(
        observator_configuration="DeepSurveySim/settings/SEO.yaml"
    )()

survey_config = ReadConfig(
        observator_configuration="DeepSurveySim/settings/equatorial_survey.yaml",
        survey=True
    )()

env = Survey(seo_config, survey_config)
observation = env._observation_calculation()

stop = True
while not stop:
    action = model.predict_action(observation)
    observation, reward, stop, log = env.step()
```

## To generate observations

```
from DeepSurveySim.Survey.survey import Survey
from DeepSurveySim.IO.read_config import ReadConfig

seo_config = ReadConfig(
        observator_configuration="DeepSurveySim/settings/SEO.yaml"
    )()

survey_config = ReadConfig(
        observator_configuration="DeepSurveySim/settings/equatorial_survey.yaml",
        survey=True
    )()

env = Survey(seo_config, survey_config)
observations = env()
```
