## Introduction

## Physics Background
- Things about observing in general

## Reinforcement Learning Background (??)
- Discussion of how RL works. Very basically.

## The Challenge

### Data
- Instructions on how to run the simulation

### Submission Structure
- Idk if this is needed

### General Guidelines

### Evaulation
- Evaluate on our reward function
- Whatever our reward function is

## Simulation

### Description
- What's in the sim. How does it work. Briefly.

### Simplications
- No weather
- Deteriminist system
- The light-brightness model

### Variable Descriptions
- Action variables
- ALL possible observation variables
